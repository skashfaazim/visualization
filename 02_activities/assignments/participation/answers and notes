Class 1: Introduction to Data Visualization
Activity: What is Good Data Visualization?

Visualization Example 1 – Aspect Ratio Comparison
Aesthetic:  No – stretched aspect ratio distorts perception
Substantive: Yes – represents same data
Perceptual:  Poor – difficult to compare trends

Visualization Example 2 – Wind Map (hint.fm/wind)
Aesthetic: Visually engaging
Substantive: Somewhat – lacks numerical scale, but shows direction/speed
Perceptual:Clearly shows movement and structure

Summary:
Good data visualization should balance:
Aesthetic: Pleasing and not overwhelming
Substantive: Honest and accurate representation
Perceptual: Understandable and purposeful


Class 4: Choosing the Right Visualization
Activity: Compare Two Gun Violence Visualizations

1. Periscopic (US Gun Killings 2018)
Message: Shows years of life lost to gun violence
Emotion: Strong and advocacy-focused
Neutrality: Not neutral – aims to persuade
Use Case: Ideal for advocacy

2. Washington Post (Mass Shootings)
Message: Trends and types of active shooter incidents
Emotion: Controlled and minimal
Neutrality: More neutral and research-oriented
Use Case: Ideal for objective reporting or academic use

Reflection:
Both visualizations are factually correct
Presentation style and emotional tone shape perception
Neutrality is a design choice — not a default
