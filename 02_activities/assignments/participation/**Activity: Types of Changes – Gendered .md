**Activity: Types of Changes â€“ Gendered Language Visualization**

- **Types of Changes**: When interacting with this dynamic visualization, we can filter by rating type (all, only positive, only negative), or enter specific keywords. This updates the frequency counts and layout, helping us explore patterns in gendered word usage.

- **Spatial and Retinal Elements**: 
  - *Constant*: Axis orientation, word categories, and color-coding by gender remain stable.
  - *Changing*: Position of the dots (based on word frequency), visibility of certain terms, and the total number of entries shown dynamically change based on the filter applied.

- **Redesign Suggestions**: I would keep the interactivity but add a tooltip or legend that explains how to interpret dot positions more clearly. Also, grouping similar disciplines or clustering patterns by sentiment may improve the storytelling. I might also use icons or symbols next to the subjects to make it more visual and fun. The current design is strong but can be enhanced for accessibility and interpretability.
