# Activity: The Brooks Slave Ship Diagram and the Three Elements of Persuasion

## Description:
The diagram of the ship *Brooks* was presented to the British Parliament to demonstrate the horrific and inhumane conditions under which enslaved Africans were transported across the Atlantic. It visually details how enslaved individuals were packed tightly together with no space to move.

## How does this visualization persuade?

### 1. Rational Appeal:
The diagram provides clear, factual, and structured visual information. By quantifying the number of enslaved people crammed into confined spaces (1,127 people illustrated), the visualization helps the audience understand the magnitude of the cruelty. This appeal to reason supports the conclusion that the conditions were unacceptable.

### 2. Moral Appeal:
This visualization taps into the viewer's sense of justice. It highlights the violation of human dignity and forces viewers to confront the ethical depravity of slavery. By showing individuals as small identical figures packed like cargo, it powerfully evokes the moral dilemma and dehumanization inflicted by the slave trade.

### 3. Emotional Appeal:
The image evokes feelings of horror, grief, and empathy. The lifeless, mechanical rows of tiny human figures call forth an emotional reaction â€” compassion for the enslaved and disgust toward those who enabled or profited from such systems. Its starkness and simplicity leave a haunting impression, making it difficult for the viewer to ignore the suffering it represents.
